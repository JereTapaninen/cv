# Armed-Kart
A game by Frozen Team

Armed Kart is an IT-student-made mobile rally game, which will have both single player (you against the artificial intelligence) and a multiplayer (one versus one, four people FFA). The game will feature a lot of rallying, many cool UPGRADABLE cars, GUNS (oh boy!), the good old fog of war from the legendary DOS game Rally Sport, since this game is based on just that game!

The game will be released in February.
