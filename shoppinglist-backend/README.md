# Backend for the shoppinglist application

This is the backend for the shoppinglist application.

The shoppinglist application is an application I made when I was in the process of getting a job from BitFactor. This backend was made using a boilerplate for mongoDB.

## How to run this locally

* You should first install MongoDB and run it locally (mongod.exe)
	* Note: MongoDB server should run on localhost
* Then, you should run `npm install`
* Then, either run start.bat or run `npm start`
* After that, if your mongoDB server is running, the backend should work fine
* Next you should setup the frontend
	* Get the frontend from <a href=https://github.com/JereTapaninen/shoppinglist>here</a>
